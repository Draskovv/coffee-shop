description: Too many of these and you might have to ‘just crash here, bro’, because this type of coffee is brewed with whiskey, sugar, and a thick layer of cream on the top – and isn’t readily available in New Zealand Café’s due to its alcohol content, they’re more often found in restaurants.  Be warned that trying to make this with scotch and instant coffee doesn’t work… trust us.
